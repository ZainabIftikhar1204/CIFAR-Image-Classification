# CIFAR-Image-Classification

## Description
This project includes a custom CNN trained on the popular CIFAR dataset containing 10 classes of images. The model was then used to create a basic Image Classification web app using Gradio. The app can be accessed via the following link for playaround:

> ❗ Please note that this app was deployed on 25th July, 2024 on around 4:00pm using Gradio. Therefore, it will only stay hosted for 72 hours i.e. until **4:00pm on 28th July, 2024**. In order to access the application after that time, please follow the instructions mentioned in *How to Run Locally* section.


## Model Architecture
The CNN model designed for this project follows the following architecture:

In order to get more information about the model and to see it in action, you can run the *Trained_Model* notebook. 


## How to Run Locally
In order to locally run the app on your side, please follow the following instructions"

1. Open the *CIFAR_Gradio_Interface.ipynb* file in an editor of your choice (Jupyter/Colab). 
2. Then upload the saved model file *cnn_cifar10.keras* in your runtime. 
3. Run all the cells in the notebook to get a new hosted app that you can then play around with in your notebook or in the browser through the provided link. 
4. Upload an image in the web app as an input.
5. Click Submit to get a prediction.



Enjoy ✌
